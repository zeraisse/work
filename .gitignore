# Unignore the gitignore itself

# If you have other notebooks to keep, unignore them explicitly, for example:
# !/TD_pySpark.ipynb

# Unignore directories if you want to push specific files within them (none by default)
# Example to allow a specific file inside model/ uncomment and set the path:
# !/model/somefile.ipynb
